#App Idea: Gong Mobile App

####Why it needs to exist(what problem does it solve?)

Consider the following statistics:

```
* People
-54% of Americans suffer from stress.
- 18 million meditate
- 36 million Americans practice yoga
- 50% growth from 2016-2018
- 55 million practice some form of alternative healing.
- 133 million Americans are affected by some sort of chronic disease 

* Sales
- Mediation sales expected to hit $2 billion by 2022
- Yoga sales are at $16 billion a year on classes, clothes, equipment, apps and websites each year.
- Americans spend $30.2 billion on alternative healing.
- Apple App store did $34billion in sales in 2018
```

Well made gongs that produce sounds for sound healing therapy can cost a couple thousand dollars at minimum

####How it solves the problem.

It allows users to gain access to a life-like sounding gong and give them the ability to control the sound that gong produces. This means they can create these sounds live or record a session and replay the recording for meditation and sound therapy. 

####What the app is and how it works.

The app is similar to other sound producing click apps but will focus on maintaining the unique sounds and techniques when playing an actual gong. Users will have the ability to switch between different gongs and mallets to produce different sounds. They can produce different sounds by clicking on different areas of the gong, make buttons available to adjust the strength of the strike, and even glide their finger around it to produce a powerful whale-like hum.

####Show the class your first few pages of the web app.

This will be included in our presentation

####What technologies will you use

Our idea is to make this into a mobile app that we will list on both markets so we will use Native React. We will also need a database to store user information as well as recordings. Later iteration may include social sharing aspects which will include making use of various APIs. Aside from code, we will use other programs and equipment to record the powerful sounds a gong can make and take/edit photos of the gongs. 

####What questions do YOU have about your app

- Layering sound in order to preserve the gong ringing
- Clicking vs Holding specific to an area
- CSS animations to resemble the affects of striking a gong
- React Native (and all the tools/packages that come along with it)
- The unknown unkowns
